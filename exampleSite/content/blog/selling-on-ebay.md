### Create Attractable Profile

The first step is the most vital. This step is creating a profile that stands out. Be sure to include keyword phrases in your description on your profile. Then, your profile must appear mistake free. Potential customers may view your profile before they decide to purchase items that are listed.

### Use Digital Camera

Use a digital camera when taking photos of your inventory. Professional photos always stand out on web pages. Customers appreciate quality, especially when they are not buying directly from a company. You do not need the most expensive camera to take photos, but be sure to have a decent camera.

### Buy Wholesale Products

Buying for less and selling for more is the most effective way to increase profits. The resources that you can apply are all up to you. You can start at garage sales, pawnshops, antique shops, wholesale stores, drop-shipping companies, liquidation closeout sales, government auctions, and manufacturing companies. The list goes on; it is up to you to continue to research and keep your resources updated.

### Don’t Post Replicas

Stay away from posting fake or replica products and merchandise. Not only will this frustrate the buyer, but it will also jeopardize your account. Meaning your account will get banned. Sometimes you should put yourself in the same shoes as the buyer; look at it from a customer’s perspective. Think about when you buy items. You want to feel safe and know that you can rely on the seller to deliver exactly what is being purchased.

### Optimize Your Title

Optimizing your title for the search engine can be an enormous boost. You can start gaining traffic from major search engines. The search engine is working for you twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week. If you can get your auction listed on the search engine results, your profits can increase tremendously. I advise you to pay attention to how many keywords you use for your description. Ordinarily, keywords in your description should be under 6%.

### Identify Trending Products

Search for [eBays trending products](https://www.ebay.com/deals/trending/all). Figure out what’s hot or selling the most. You can actually find this information on the site itself. Once you find out what is selling, locate your resources and seek to get the product at a cheaper price. Since the product is already trending, there should be several purchases being made. If you’re able to get several products that are listed in the trending (hot) section, you can attain a generous amount of money.

### Ship Items on Time

It is vital to make sure every transaction goes well when you list items. Therefore, your customers must receive their goods in a timely fashion. Because you want nothing but excellent reviews. Customers have the option to write reviews on how they feel about the purchase. It is valuable to have superb reviews for the future if you are looking to make money with consistency.
