No matter what your current situation is, you must *find simple ways to save money*. Of course, this is if you want to get ahead in life. Some people believe if they were rich they wouldn’t need to save money, but this is not true. We always see stories of rich people going broke. Therefore, people that are millionaires have to budget and save money. So this blog will focus on simple ways to save money!

## 10 Money Saving Tips

There are thousands of reasons individuals should save money. But, I will only name a few. I’d like to begin with a quote from the award-winning film, Forrest Gump, in which Forrest stated, “Life is like a box of chocolates, you never know what you ‘re gonna get”.

Think about it. You never know when the unthinkable will happen. Your car could break down, you might lose your job, someone in your family can become ill. A family member may need a loan. You may have an out-of-town emergency.

The list goes on. Emergencies and situations pop up all the time. You just have to do your best to stay prepared. If you stay ready, you don’t have to get ready. Even if it means finding a side hustle. Luckily for you, there are many legit ways to to earn money online these days. Here are 10 money saving methods:

### 1. Shop at Bargain Stores

If you are the type of person who shops for high-end items (designer), that is fine. However, you probably should shop at bargain stores. Or, find stores that have deals or discounts. Find cheap outlet stores that are near you, second-hand stores. You can get the same products that you are paying retail prices for.

Believe it or not, there are many brand-new items that are sold at second-hand stores. Stores like Goodwill or St. Vincent De Paul. You can always downgrade the clothes that you are wearing. You may even want to consider knock-off brands if your money is tight. By the same token, you can save money by shopping at online stores.

### 2. Turn Off Unused Lights

Saving money in your home can add up in the long run. First, you will always want to turn the lights off when you are not using them, unplug cords that are not being used, keep your heat on at room temperature, and when buying new appliances, make sure they are energy efficient (preferable gas because electricity will continue to go up), and lastly purchase energy-saving light bulbs to keep the cost down as well.

### 3. Winterize Your Home

Winterizing your home will help you save money. Especially if you have an old house. Older homes typically have problems maintaining heat. But there are a few adjustments you can make in an old house. First, find something to seal the fireplace. At the top of the fireplace, you can buy a flap. This opens and closes to seal the top, pushing the heat back into the house. They say over sixty percent of the heat in your house leaks through windows and the front door. Therefore, it’s essential to make sure that your home is air-sealed. So place material (plastic, sheets) over the windows and in front of the door if this is a problem for you.

### 4. Save on Gas Money

Cars can eat money if they’re not taken care of. Therefore, when you’re trying to save money, you must keep up with your vehicle. This means your vehicle should be up to date with oil changes, tune-ups, and solid tires. In addition, try to keep your gas tank over half full. This will save you a vast amount of money on gas.

If you’re looking to purchase a vehicle, start with gas savers (smart cars). If you can’t find a smart car, search for cars with 4 or 6 cylinder engines. Or you could also search for a gas saver, like a Honda or Toyota.

Last but not least, you can catch the bus sometimes; you do not always have to drive everywhere. You could always go for an enjoyable walk!

### 5. Put Money Away

Be sure to put aside money every paycheck. Even if it’s only ten dollars a month. This adds up to one hundred and twenty dollars at the end of the year. This may not seem like much, but it’s more than you had before. You should live by the code “a penny saved is a penny earned.”

If you have a job, you might take your own lunch to work. Going out to eat daily or buying lunch at your job can add up. Eat leftovers from the night before. When you go to the grocery store, be sure to buy snacks you may want while you’re at work.

### 6. Change Eating Habits

Changing your eating habits can enable you to save money in the long haul. Instead of going out to eat, you can eat more meals at home. Eat more vegetables instead of eating meat. Cutting back on meat can help your health as well. Be sure to cut out the excess snacking, including cookies, sodas, and chips.

### 7. Find Inexpensive Hobbies

If your hobbies comprise spending money, find other activities that you enjoy that don’t cost any money. Usually, physical or outdoor activities are the ones that do not cost too much. If you like to go out to dinner for a hobby, start going on picnics to places that are enjoyable, like the beach or the park.

### 8. Liquidate Bills

Look at all your bills and examine for bills you can live without. The first three would be your cable, internet, and phone bill. If you have a bundle package, determine if other companies are offering lower rates for the current subscriptions that you have. Using your washer after nine o’clock at night will save you money on your water bill.

### 9. Open a Savings Account

If you don’t have a savings account, sign up for one. Keeping money in the bank will help you save money in the long run. If the money is not constantly in your face, you will be less likely to spend it. If you have your money in the bank account, you will collect interest. This is a perfect win situation, saving money to make money.

### 10. Earn Rebates and Get Cash Back From Internet Purchases

Did you know you can get cashback shopping? There are thousands of companies that enable members to earn cashback from apps purchases.

#### Final Thoughts on Saving Money

Ask yourself one question. Are the items that you buy daily, items that you want or need? First, look at your spending habits. Are you spending money on food, fun, or business? Obviously, if you are spending money on business, it does not apply. This applies to all the things that we as people waste money.

It is always wise to be prepared or save money just in case. You will need to borrow money if you’re not prepared, which leads to more debt.
