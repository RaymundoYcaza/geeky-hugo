## Steps to Make Money on Craigslist

The sale of goods can be a profitable side hustle. However, if you want to make money on Craigslist, you must understand the basics of selling items on Craigslist. Fundamentals like don’t post duplicate content, respond to buyers A.S.A.P., or don’t meet people at nighttime. In addition, you must have a strategy. By strategizing, you can increase profits and sales. Instead of earning $300 posts, you could earn $500.

Finally, be sure to read the policies, terms of service, and posting options before posting ads. The site currently allows you to repost your advertisements every forty-eight hours. Your account can get flagged by not following the rules, or even worse banned. At any rate, below are effective marketing strategies that can help you maximize your profits:

### 1. Create a Craigslist Account

If you do not have an account, start by signing up for a free membership. It will benefit you to have an account. You can use more features and keep track of all your postings. This will help you identify titles and phrases that are effective.

### 2. Browse Though the Site

To begin, browse around and get familiar with the site. Check out the pages or posts you’re interested in. Even check out the content you are not interested in. Click through all the sections to get familiar with the site. It can be time-consuming to contact customer support for information that is already provided on the site.

### 3. Upload Photos

You need to upload photos to your post to attract customers. When a post has photos, buyers are more likely to click through. In addition, ads that look professional also attract more attention. I highly recommended using a digital camera to take photos. For those who don’t own a digital camera, consider purchasing one. It will pay off in the long run. Studies have shown low-quality photos have a high bounce rate. Whereas high-quality photos have a lower bounce rate. Maintaining a lower bounce rate is important. A lower bounce rate declares conversations with potential buyers are ensuing.

### 4. Provide Valuable Customer Service

If you’re planning to get paid on CL in the long haul, it’s essential to keep customers happy. Customer satisfaction is a key fundamental in marketing. In business, customers are essential. Without customers, a business would not exist. Therefore, you must provide valuable customer service.

### 5. Sell Unwanted Items

Believe it or not, you can make good money selling unwanted items. You can also find wholesale products in bulk to resell, basically becoming the middle man. There are many wholesale products that you can purchase from companies. Afterwards, you can turn around and resell these products.

### 6. Find Free Items to Resell

The most profitable product you can sell is something you didn’t buy. To sell are free products. Marketing products that are free yields one hundred percent return. Take advantage of the free section under the for sale column. You never know when you will get lucky. Junk to some people may not be junk to you. Sometimes people give away 42 inches Sony televisions because owners upgrade their home entertainment system. You can turn around and sell these free items!

### 7. Don’t Post Duplicate Advertisements

Never duplicate the same advertisements. Members will flag your post, and eventually, CL will not post your ad if spiders detect duplicate content. It is important to keep your headlines fresh and attention-grabbing. This will help you attract valuable visitors. It’s vital to have beneficial customers, as opposed to non-beneficial customers. Valuable buyers will usually show up on time and give you the contact information. Valuable customers also bring the correct amount of money for the purchase, things of that nature. Non-value buyers are usually the ones that are hard to deal with. These individuals always ask for a bargain, don’t show up on time, or do not show at all. In conclusion, by posting adequate material, you can influence your audience, potentially leading to qualified buyers.

### 8. Buy For Cheap, Sell For More

Buy products for cheap, then sell your products at a higher price. You can easily find places in your city that offer discounted goods. These are places like garage sales and flea markets. Here are a few other places you can browse; pawn shops, antique stores, discount stores, wholesale companies, and online drop shipping companies. It’s highly recommended you continue to research this step if you are waiting to generate profits. The more resources you find, the more money you make.

### 9. Respond to Potential Buyers A.S.A.P

A terrific way to sell your products faster is by responding to potential buyers as soon as possible. Make sure you are reachable by both methods, email, and phone. You want to be as convenient as you can for potential buyers. Some customers might be at work. Therefore, they would rather respond by email as opposed to speaking on the phone. People who post ads saying do not contact them by email are losing potential buyers. Imagine the number of people who may not even own a cell phone or landline. Cell phones are important to have because nine times out of ten you will have to meet someone at a specific location to make a purchase.

### 10. Find Jobs Under Craigslist Gigs Section

If you have time on your hands, you can always find a job under the gigs section. There are opportunities available daily in most cities. You can find computer gigs, writing gigs, creative gigs along with a few others. But if you want to work for yourself or be your own boss, Amazon work from home jobs are available.

### 11. Meet Buyers in Public

Last but not least, meet buyers in public places around crowds of people. Ordinarily, it’s safer to meet customers during the daytime. Not only for your safety, but this gives buyers a sense of safety as well. In addition, if something were to go wrong, it’s more likely to be witnessed during the daytime. Safety is number one when you are meeting strangers.

#### Paperclip to Farm House Story

Have you ever heard the [red paperclip story](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_red_paperclip). This story is about Kyle MacDonald. A man who started by trading a red paperclip on Craigslist and ended up with a farmhouse. He achieved it in fourteen transactions!

2. Thereafter, the pen got swapped for one doorknob in Seattle.
3. Next, he traded a doorknob for a camp-stove in Amherst.
4. Then he exchanged a camp-stove for a Honda generator in California.
5. After that, he bargained a Honda generator for an instant party (empty keg) in N.Y.
6. His sixth transaction involved trading an Instant Party for a ski-mobile in Quebec.
7. At that point, the Ski-mobile got traded for a two-person trip to B.C.
8. The eighth transaction involved trading a second spot for the trip, exchanged for a box truck.
9. The box truck bartered for a recording contract with American singer Jody Gnant in Ontario.
10. His tenth deal, he hawked the Jody Gnant contract for a year’s rent in Arizona.
11. A year’s rent in Arizona traded for an afternoon with Alison Cooper.
